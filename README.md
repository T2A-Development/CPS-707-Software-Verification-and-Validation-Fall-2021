# CPS-707-Software-Verification-and-Validation-Fall-2021

In this course I was introduced to the concepts, theory and practice of software quality assurance through process, testing, inspection and measurement. It is not a course in the broader aspects of software engineering, except insofar as they relate to quality control. 

# Topics to be Covered (Tentative)

## Introduction

• Quality - what is it, how is it measured, how is it achieved

## Software Process

• Software process models: plans for achieving and improving software quality

• eXtreme Programming: a controversial modern software process

## Software Testing

• Systematic Testing - what is it, levels of testing, designing for test

• Black Box Testing - functional, input, output, partitioning and gray box testing

• White Box Testing - coverage, path, decision and mutation testing

• Continuous Testing - regression, defect testing

• Test Automation - test maintenance and analysis, harnesses, tracking, tools

## Software Inspection

• Systematic Inspection - what is it, levels of inspection, inspection process, formal reviews

• Inspection in the Software Process - requirements, design, process and code inspections

• Code Inspection - techniques, practices, continuous inspection, refactoring

• Automated Inspection - static analysis, design recovery, clone detection, model checking

## Software Measurement

• Software Metrics - measurement basics, assessment and prediction

• Product Quality Metrics - external, internal, faults, failures and defects

• Code and Structure Metrics - size, complexity and functionality metrics

• Process Metrics - predicting cost and effort, regression analysis, function points

## Software Dependability and Security

• Software Security - issues and methods, web application security
